# My personal website redesign from 2022

A really simple site re-design serving as a showcase for my ever-expanding skillset in web development and music. 🚀🧘

---

- Site proudly built with [**Astro**](https://astro.build)
  - [**typed.js**](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/) for the typewriter effect. 
  - Other styling is handled purely with [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com)!

---

- I've used Astro components to make my life a little bit easier, although most of them are static assets with no assignable HTML props. An exception to this is the **Project Icon Component** which handles dynamic Font Awesome icon assignment and some additional styling through HTML props. Feel free to poke around and find out how that's been done. 👾
  - *I realise this could have been done a bit more polished way but frankly I didn't need to do that for my use case.* 🤷‍♂️
- **Font Awesome** has been manually imported as it was the least time-consuming option for me in this setting.
- Other fonts have been handled with the help of [**Fontsource**](https://fontsource.org).

Hope this helps, **now go make stuff!**
